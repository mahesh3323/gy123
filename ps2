 PRACTISEPROBLEMII:
 Ahorizontal water pipe has an abrupt enlargement such that the diameters
 of small and large cross-section are 250 mm and 450 mm respectively. The volumetric flow rate in pipe is
 0.3 m3/s. Find the head loss due to abrupt enlargement

 %Given Data
 D1 =0.25; % Diameter of the small section in meters
 D2 =0.45; % Diameter of the large section in meters
 Q=0.3; % Volumetric flow rate in m³/s
 %Cross-sectional areas
 A1 =pi *(D1^2) / 4;
 A2 =pi *(D2^2) / 4;
 % Velocities
 V1 =Q/A1;
 V2 =Q/A2;
 %Head loss due to abrupt enlargement
 g =9.81; %Acceleration due to gravity in m/s²
 hl = ((V1- V2)^2) / (2 * g);
 %Display results
 fprintf('Head loss due to abrupt enlargement: %.4f meters\n', hl);
 >> horizontalwater
 Head loss due to abrupt enlargement: 0.9099 meters
