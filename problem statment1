 PRACTISEPROBLEMI:Anoilof specific gravity 0.7 is flowing through a pipe of diameter 300mm at
 the rate of 500 litres/s. Find the head lost due to friction and power required to maintain the flow for a length
 of 1000 m. Take kinematic viscosity =0.29 stokes

 MATLABSOLUTION:
 >>%Givendata
 specific_gravity = 0.7;
 diameter_mm = 300; % diameter in mm
 flow_rate_lps = 500; % flow rate in litres per second
 length_m = 1000; % length in meters
 kinematic_viscosity_stokes = 0.29; % kinematic viscosity in stokes
 %Convertunits
 diameter_m = diameter_mm / 1000; % diameter in meters
 flow_rate_m3s = flow_rate_lps / 1000; % flow rate in cubic meters per second
 kinematic_viscosity_m2s = kinematic_viscosity_stokes * 1e-4; % kinematic viscosity in m^2/s
 %Calculate velocity
 area = pi * (diameter_m / 2)^2; % cross-sectional area in m^2
 velocity = flow_rate_m3s / area; % velocity in m/s
 %Calculate Reynolds number
 density_oil = specific_gravity * 1000; % density in kg/m^3 (assuming water density is 1000 kg/m^3)
 reynolds_number = (velocity * diameter_m) / kinematic_viscosity_m2s;
 %Determinefriction factor (using Blasius equation for turbulent flow)
 if reynolds_number < 2300
 %Laminar flow
 friction_factor = 64 / reynolds_number;
 else
 %Turbulent flow
 friction_factor = 0.079 / (reynolds_number^0.25);
 end
 %Calculate head loss due to friction (Darcy-Weisbach equation)
 head_loss = (4*friction_factor * length_m * velocity^2) / (2 * 9.81 * diameter_m); % head loss in meters
 %Calculate power required to maintain the flow
 power = density_oil * 9.81 * flow_rate_m3s * head_loss; % power in watts
 %Display results
 fprintf('Head loss due to friction: %.2f meters\n', head_loss);
 fprintf('Power required to maintain the flow: %.2f watts\n', power);
 Head loss due to friction: 163.32 meters
 Power required to maintain the flow: 560775.31 watts
