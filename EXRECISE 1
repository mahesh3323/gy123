 Ans: m3 =[m1 m2]
 mTemp=[m2 m2 m2];
 m3=[m1;mTemp]
 Date:

 2.Create an array named [x] that has [3] rows [4] columns when every member is
 the number [1]
 Code: x=ones(3,4)

 3.Create a B by 5 matrix BC concanating [B] and [C] where [B] is on the left and
 [C] on the right
 Ans :BC=[B C]

 4.What is the value of a D after running true command
 A=[0;1;2;3]
 B=[0 1]
 C=[5 10]
 D=C+A*B

 Ans: 5 10
 5

 5. Write a MATLABscript that checkseach element ofan array A = [10,-5, 8,-2, 7]. If
 the element is positive, multiply it by 2; otherwise, replace it with 0. Print the
 modified array

 %Define the array
 A=[10,-5, 8,-2, 7];
 %Initialize the modified array
 B=zeros(size(A));
 %Loopthrough arrayelements
 for i = 1:length(A)
 if A(i) > 0
 B(i) = A(i) * 2; %Multiply positive elements by 2
 else
 B(i) = 0; %Replace negative elements with 0
 end
 end
 %Display the modified array
 disp('Modified Array:'), disp(B);
